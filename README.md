Code Pupper is a chat bot for Discord which runs code written in the chat. 

Code Pupper uses these languages

- C (gcc)
- C++ (g++)
- Lua (lua)
- Python (python)
- Javascript (node)
- Swift (swift)

Code Pupper can also save images or files and send them back, by taking the last sent attachment and saving it.

## Setup

All the above languages should be installed and available if you plan to use them.

Node.js should be installed, both for Javascript and to run Code Pupper. Discordie will also be required.

`npm install Discordie`

Once you have created a Discord bot, you will need to copy your bot's token into the code at line 9 of `index.js`.

Use the `run` script to start the bot or `node index.js`.
